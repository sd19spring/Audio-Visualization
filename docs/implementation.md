The visualizations are populated by two different classes of shapes: Rectangle and Circle.  
For Rectangles, their width and heights are determined by the energy of the song being played.  High energy songs lead to the creation of bigger shapes and vice versa with low energy songs.  Similarly, the speed at which a Rectangle moves is determined by how danceable a song is deemed by Spotify.  The more danceable a song the faster it moves.
Each class has multiple methods to determine how the shapes moves throughout the visualization.
