The purpose of this algorithm...

To run, you must have Spotipy installed. You can do this with:

$ pip install spotipy

You must also create your own client id and place it in a file called clients.py
so that the script can access spotify data. There is a template file named
clients_template.py which can be edited once you have your own Spotify web API
client id.
