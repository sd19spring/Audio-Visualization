# Our Path to a Product
When we started this project, we envisioned a plugin to Spotify that would allow you to click a button and a visualization would start alongside your music. While we weren't able to connect the program to Spotify, we were able to use the API to the best of our abilities to synchronize music and have the visualization unique to every individual song. Our MVP didn't include multiple color schemes, but after user feedback, we implemented color schemes based on the song's "mood" which is given from Spotify. We initially weren't going to include a search functionality and were only going to have the program pull whatever song you were currently listening to and create a visual for that. However, we quickly realized that there was a lot of back and forth between Spotify's UI and our own UI which was complicated. Instead, we pivoted to the ability to search or listen to whatever song you were currently playing in Spotify. This allowed us to include additional functionality while keeping the product easy to use.
